# Selection Sets Feature

## Overview

The Selection Sets feature allows you to save, load, and manage different selections of training images for each style. This is useful for:

- Creating different training data subsets for experimentation
- Organizing images by quality, theme, or purpose
- Quick switching between different image selections
- Maintaining multiple curated sets per style

```

### File Format
```json
{
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "filenames": [

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Creating Quality Tiers
1. Select all high-quality images
2. Click **üìÅ Sets** ‚Üí **üíæ Save New**
3. Set 1 is created with high-quality images
4. Deselect all, select medium-quality images
5. Save as Set 2
6. Switch between sets by clicking them in the menu

### Example 2: Testing Different Subsets
1. Select 20 images for initial training
2. Save as Set 1
3. Train model with Set 1
4. Select different 20 images
5. Save as Set 2
6. Train model with Set 2
7. Compare results

### Example 3: Organizing by Theme
1. Select all landscape images ‚Üí Save as Set 1
2. Select all portrait images ‚Üí Save as Set 2
3. Select all action images ‚Üí Save as Set 3
4. Quickly switch between themes for different training runs

## Tips

1. **Use Hide Unselected** to focus on your current selection without distraction
2. **Update sets** instead of creating new ones when refining a selection
3. **Delete unused sets** to keep the menu clean
4. **Set numbers are permanent** - deleted numbers are not reused
5. **Sets are per-style** - each style has its own independent sets

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Selection sets loaded on component mount
- Current set ID tracked in state
- Deselecting all clears current set
- Loading a set updates selection and current set ID

### Auto-numbering
- Next available ID calculated from existing sets
- Uses `Math.max(...existingIds) + 1`
- First set is always ID 1

### Click Outside Detection
- Menu closes when clicking outside
- Uses ref and event listener
- Cleanup on component unmount

### Hide Unselected Filter
- Filters `visibleImages` array
- Grid only renders filtered images
- Original indices preserved for checkbox toggling
- Disabled when no selection exists

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Set renaming (custom names instead of just numbers)
- Set descriptions/notes
- Set duplication
- Bulk operations (merge sets, intersect sets)
- Export/import sets between styles
- Set statistics (S3 sync status, file sizes)
