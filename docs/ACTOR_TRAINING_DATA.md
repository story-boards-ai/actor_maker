# Actor Training Data Management System

## Overview

The Actor Training Data Management System provides a comprehensive interface for managing training images for each actor. Unlike the style-based system which generates training images on-demand, the actor system works with pre-existing training images stored in S3 and allows bidirectional synchronization between local storage and S3.

## Key Differences from Style Training Data

| Feature | Style Training Data | Actor Training Data |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Source** | Generated from base images using img2img | Pre-existing in S3, downloaded as needed |
| **Base Images** | Multiple base images (v2) | Single base image per actor |
| **Generation** | On-demand batch generation | Already generated, stored in S3 |
| **Workflow** | Generate ‚Üí Save locally ‚Üí Use | Download from S3 ‚Üí Use ‚Üí Upload changes |
| **Count** | Variable per style | Typically 14-20 images per actor |

## Architecture

### Data Structure

```
data/actors/{actor_name}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base_image/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {actor_name}_base.png          # Single base image for the actor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ training_data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ request.json                    # Original training generation request
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ response.json                   # S3 URLs and metadata
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {actor_name}_0.png             # Training image 0 (if synced locally)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {actor_name}_1.png             # Training image 1 (if synced locally)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                             # Additional training images
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ poster_frame/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {actor_name}_poster_urls.json  # Poster frame URLs
```

### S3 Storage Structure

**Bucket:** `story-boards-assets`

**Training Data Path:**
```
system_actors/training_data/{actor_name}/{actor_name}_{index}.png
```

**Example:**
```
system_actors/training_data/0002_european_35_female/0002_european_35_female_0.png
system_actors/training_data/0002_european_35_female/0002_european_35_female_1.png
...
system_actors/training_data/0002_european_35_female/0002_european_35_female_19.png
```

## Integration Points

### Actor Type Extension

**Location:** `ui/src/types.ts`

Added `training_data` field to Actor interface:

```typescript
export interface Actor {
  // ... existing fields ...
  training_data?: {
    s3_urls: string[];
    local_path: string;
    base_image_path: string;
    count: number;
    synced: boolean;
  };
}
```

### ActorCard Integration

**Location:** `ui/src/components/ActorCard.tsx`

Added "üì∏ Training Data" button that opens the training manager in a new tab.

### App.tsx Integration

**Location:** `ui/src/App.tsx`

- Added `ActorTrainingTab` interface
- Added `handleOpenActorTraining` handler
- Added dynamic tab for actor training manager
- Integrated with existing tab system

## Technical Details

### S3 URL Parsing

The system handles both S3 URL formats:
- Standard: `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/path/file.png`
- Accelerated: `https://bucket.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/path/file.png`

### File Naming Convention

**Base Image:**
- Format: `{actor_name}_base.png`
- Example: `0002_european_35_female_base.png`

**Training Images:**
- Format: `{actor_name}_{index}.png`
- Example: `0002_european_35_female_0.png`
- Index: 0-19 (typically 20 images)

### Local vs S3 Status

The system tracks which images exist locally vs only in S3:

- **Local Images:** Listed in `local_images` array
- **S3 URLs:** Listed in `s3_urls` array from response.json
- **Synced:** Boolean indicating if all S3 images are downloaded

### Progress Tracking

Both sync operations provide real-time progress:
- Progress bar shows current/total
- Status messages display in UI
- Errors logged to console and returned in response

## Environment Requirements

### AWS Credentials

Required environment variables:
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
AWS_ACCESS_SECRET=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-west-1
```

### Python Dependencies

```bash
boto3>=1.26.0
```

Install with:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**"Actor not found"**
- Actor ID doesn't exist in actorsData.json
- Check actor ID is correct

**"Training data directory not found"**
- Actor doesn't have training_data folder
- Run sync-from-s3 to create and populate

**"AWS credentials not configured"**
- Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_SECRET
- Check .env file in project root

**"Failed to download from S3"**
- Check AWS credentials
- Verify S3 URLs are correct
- Check network connectivity

**"Failed to upload to S3"**
- Check AWS credentials
- Verify write permissions to bucket
- Check local images exist

### Recovery

**Partial Download Failure:**
- Script skips already downloaded images
- Re-run sync-from-s3 to retry failed images
- Check errors array in response

**Partial Upload Failure:**
- Script skips already uploaded images
- Re-run sync-to-s3 to retry failed images
- Check errors array in response

## Performance Considerations

### Download Performance

- **Concurrent Downloads:** Currently sequential (one at a time)
- **Typical Time:** ~2-3 seconds per image
- **Total Time:** ~40-60 seconds for 20 images
- **Network:** Depends on connection speed

### Upload Performance

- **Concurrent Uploads:** Currently sequential
- **Typical Time:** ~3-5 seconds per image
- **Total Time:** ~60-100 seconds for 20 images
- **Network:** Depends on connection speed

### Storage

- **Per Actor:** ~20 images √ó ~2MB = ~40MB
- **287 Actors:** ~11.5GB total if all synced
- **Recommendation:** Sync only needed actors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Training Image Generation**
   - Implement img2img workflow for actors
   - Generate variations from base image
   - Apply different poses, expressions, lighting

2. **Parallel Downloads/Uploads**
   - Process multiple images concurrently
   - Reduce total sync time
   - Add concurrency configuration

3. **Selective Sync**
   - Choose specific images to download
   - Range selection (e.g., images 0-9)
   - Smart sync based on usage

4. **Image Preview**
   - Full-size image viewer
   - Compare base vs training images
   - Side-by-side comparison mode

5. **Batch Operations**
   - Sync multiple actors at once
   - Bulk download/upload
   - Progress tracking per actor

6. **Cache Management**
   - Clear local cache
   - Selective deletion
   - Storage usage monitoring

## Best Practices

### When to Sync from S3

- **First time using an actor:** Download all training images
- **After S3 updates:** Re-sync to get latest versions
- **Disk space available:** Only if you have sufficient storage

### When to Sync to S3

- **After generating new images:** Backup to S3
- **After modifying images:** Update S3 versions
- **Before sharing:** Ensure team has access

### Storage Management

- **Sync selectively:** Only download actors you're actively using
- **Clean up periodically:** Delete unused local images
- **Monitor disk space:** Check available storage before syncing

### Workflow Tips

1. **Start with sync-from-s3** to get existing training data
2. **Work locally** for faster access
3. **Sync-to-s3** when done to backup changes
4. **Use local images** for training to avoid S3 costs

## Troubleshooting

### Images not appearing in UI

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify images downloaded to correct path
3. Refresh the training data manager
4. Check file permissions

### Sync stuck or slow

1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify AWS credentials are valid
3. Check S3 bucket permissions
4. Monitor Python script output

### Missing base image

1. Check `base_image` directory exists
2. Verify filename matches pattern
3. Download from S3 if needed
4. Check actor data migration

## Conclusion

The Actor Training Data Management System provides a complete solution for managing pre-existing training images stored in S3. It enables easy synchronization between local storage and S3, with a clean UI for viewing and managing training data per actor.

Key benefits:
- ‚úÖ View all training images per actor
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional S3 sync
- ‚úÖ Track local vs S3 status
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking and error handling
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing actor library
- ‚úÖ Scalable to 287+ actors

Happy training! üé≠
