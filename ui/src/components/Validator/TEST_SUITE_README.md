# Test Suite System for Validator

## Overview

The test suite system allows you to run comprehensive batch tests on trained LoRA models using predefined sets of prompts. This is essential for:

- **Quality assurance**: Validate model performance across diverse scenarios
- **Comparison**: Compare different training versions side-by-side
- **Documentation**: Create visual galleries of model capabilities
- **Regression testing**: Ensure new training doesn't degrade existing capabilities

## Features

### üé¨ 20 Cinematic Scene Prompts

The default "Cinematic Scenes" test suite includes 20 carefully crafted storyboard prompts covering:

- **Noir scenes** (detective in rain-soaked alley)
- **Horror moments** (close-up terror reactions)
- **Western landscapes** (lone figure in desert)
- **Thriller sequences** (hacker workspaces, split focus)
- **Romance** (moonlit beach embraces)
- **Action** (superhero impacts, chase sequences, team walks)
- **Period dramas** (Victorian libraries, formal dinners)
- **Sci-fi** (space exploration, zero gravity)
- **Fantasy** (warrior victories)
- **And more...**

Each prompt is designed to test different cinematographic techniques (angles, framing, lighting, composition).

### üìä Automated Batch Processing

- Generates all 20 images sequentially with your current settings
- Progress tracking with live counter
- Automatic local storage of results
- Comprehensive metadata logging

### üñºÔ∏è Beautiful Results Viewer

- **Modal interface** with large image preview
- **Thumbnail grid** for quick navigation
- **Keyboard controls** (‚Üê ‚Üí arrows, ESC to close)
- **Detailed metadata** for each image:
  - Category badge (color-coded by genre)
  - Original test prompt
  - Full assembled prompt (with frontpad/backpad)
  - Seed value
  - Generation timestamp
- **Settings summary** (expandable footer with all generation parameters)

### üíæ Organized File Storage

Results are saved to:
```
resources/style_images/{styleId}/test_results/{resultId}/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ result.json          # Complete metadata
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cs-01.jpg           # Test image 1
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cs-02.jpg           # Test image 2
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                 # All 20 images
```

Result ID format: `{suiteId}_{timestamp}`  
Example: `cinematic-scenes-v1_2025-10-11T18-23-45Z`

## How to Use

### 1. Select Your Model

- Choose a **Style** from the style selector
- Choose a **Trained LoRA Model** from the dropdown
- Configure your generation settings (or use saved defaults)

### 2. Load Test Suites

- Click the **"üìÇ Load"** button in the Test Suite section
- The available test suites will load (currently: "Cinematic Scenes")

### 3. Select a Test Suite

- Choose from the dropdown (shows: `Suite Name (20 prompts)`)
- Read the description to understand what it tests

### 4. Run the Suite

- Click **"üé¨ Run Test Suite"**
- Watch the progress bar as images generate (may take 20-40 minutes)
- Check the logs for detailed progress
- Single images still work - test suite runs are independent

### 5. View Results

- Results modal opens automatically when complete
- **Navigate**: Use left/right arrows or click thumbnails
- **Inspect**: View prompts, settings, metadata
- **Export**: Images are already saved locally in the style folder

## Creating Custom Test Suites

### Test Suite JSON Format

Create a new file in `/ui/test-suites/{your-suite-name}.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "your-suite-id",
  "name": "Your Suite Name",
  "description": "What this suite tests",
  "version": "1.0",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "id": "test-01",
      "prompt": "Your test prompt here",
      "category": "genre-name",
      "description": "What this tests"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Prompt Design Tips

1. **Be specific**: Include camera angles, lighting, composition details
2. **Vary complexity**: Mix simple and complex scenes
3. **Test edge cases**: Unusual angles, difficult lighting, multiple subjects
4. **Cover use cases**: Include scenarios relevant to your style
5. **Keep consistent**: Use similar structure across prompts for fair comparison

### Category Colors

Available category badges:
- `noir`, `horror`, `western`, `thriller`, `romance`, `action`
- `period`, `drama`, `family`, `sci-fi`, `espionage`, `fantasy`
- `music`, `adventure`

Each has a distinct color scheme in the results viewer.

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

Two backend routes handle file storage:

**POST /api/save-test-image**
- Downloads image from RunPod URL
- Saves to local filesystem
- Returns local path for results

**POST /api/save-test-result**
- Saves complete test metadata as JSON
- Includes all settings, prompts, and image references

### Image Generation Flow

1. Load test suite prompts
2. For each prompt:
   - Use current settings (steps, CFG, guidance, etc.)
   - Generate seed (random if unlocked, fixed if locked)
   - Build full prompt (trigger + frontpad + test prompt + backpad)
   - Call generation API
   - Download and save result
   - Add 1 second delay between requests
3. Compile results into TestSuiteResult object
4. Save all images and metadata
5. Display results modal

### Performance Notes

- **Generation time**: ~1-2 minutes per image = 20-40 minutes total
- **Storage**: ~20-40 MB per test suite (depending on resolution)
- **Network**: Downloads all images from RunPod to local storage
- **Blocking**: UI remains responsive; you can't run another test while one is active

## Best Practices

### For Model Training

1. **Baseline test**: Run test suite on first training version
2. **After changes**: Run after each significant training iteration
3. **Compare results**: Visual side-by-side comparison of result folders
4. **Document progress**: Keep test results to track improvements

### For Quality Assurance

1. **Consistent settings**: Use same settings across test runs for fair comparison
2. **Locked seeds**: Consider locking seed for exact reproducibility
3. **Multiple runs**: Run 2-3 times to account for randomness
4. **Category analysis**: Check if certain categories consistently fail

### For Documentation

1. **Share results**: Results folder is perfect for showcasing model capabilities
2. **Portfolio**: Use results for client presentations
3. **Training examples**: Show before/after training improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Test suite won't load
- Ensure JSON file is in `/ui/test-suites/` directory
- Check JSON syntax validity
- Verify file is served by dev server

### Generation fails mid-suite
- Check logs for specific error
- Verify RunPod endpoint is available
- Check credit/quota limits
- Test with single image first

### Images not saving locally
- Check file permissions on `resources/style_images/` directory
- Verify backend API routes are configured
- Check disk space availability

### Modal won't display images
- Check browser console for path errors
- Verify images were actually saved
- Check network tab for 404s

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not yet implemented):

- **Multiple test suites**: Character portraits, landscape scenes, action sequences
- **Comparison mode**: Side-by-side view of two test results
- **Export reports**: PDF generation with all results
- **Filtering**: View only specific categories
- **Ratings**: Add quality ratings to each result
- **A/B testing**: Automated comparison of parameter variations

## Example Workflow

```
1. Train LoRA model ‚Üí "my-style-v1"
2. Go to Validator tab
3. Select style + trained model
4. Load test suite ‚Üí "Cinematic Scenes"
5. Run test suite ‚Üí 20 images generate
6. Review results in modal
7. Identify weak areas (e.g., "horror scenes lack contrast")
8. Adjust training data/parameters
9. Train new version ‚Üí "my-style-v2"
10. Run same test suite
11. Compare folders side-by-side
12. Repeat until satisfied
```

This creates a systematic, data-driven approach to model improvement!
