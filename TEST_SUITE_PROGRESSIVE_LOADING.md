# Test Suite Progressive Loading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented real-time progressive loading for test suite results. The results modal now opens immediately when starting a test suite and displays images as they are generated, providing live feedback on the generation progress.

## Changes Made

### 1. **useTestSuiteJob Hook** (`/ui/src/components/Validator/hooks/useTestSuiteJob.ts`)

#### Modified `loadJobResults` function
- Added `silent` parameter to control logging behavior
- Only opens modal on first load (when not already open)
- Subsequent calls silently update the results without logging
- Enables progressive updates without spam in logs

#### Modified SSE message handler
```typescript
if (status.status === 'running') {
  props.addLog(`Progress: ${status.progress.current}/${status.progress.total}`);
  
  // Load partial results to show images as they come in
  if (status.resultId) {
    loadJobResults(props.selectedStyle, status.resultId);
  }
}
```

#### Modified polling fallback
- Same progressive loading behavior for polling mechanism
- Ensures consistent experience whether using SSE or polling

#### Modified `runTestSuite` function
- Initializes empty `TestSuiteResult` object immediately
- Opens modal right away with empty images array
- Images populate progressively as they complete
- Added log message: "üì∫ Results modal opened - images will appear as they generate"

### 2. **TestSuiteResultsModal Component** (`/ui/src/components/Validator/components/TestSuiteResultsModal.tsx`)

#### Added loading states
- `hasImages` check to determine if any images have been generated yet
- Loading spinner and message when no images are available yet
- Dynamic counter showing current number of results

#### Main image display
```tsx
{!hasImages ? (
  <div className="no-image">
    <div className="loading-spinner">‚è≥</div>
    <p>Generating images...</p>
    <p className="loading-hint">Images will appear here as they complete</p>
  </div>
) : currentImage ? (
  // ... existing image display
)}
```

#### Thumbnail grid
- Shows "‚è≥ Waiting for images..." when empty
- Dynamically updates count: "All Results (X)"
- Thumbnails appear as images complete

## User Experience Flow

### Before (Old Behavior)
1. Click "Run Test Suite"
2. Wait for entire suite to complete
3. Modal opens with all results at once
4. No visibility into progress

### After (New Behavior)
1. Click "Run Test Suite"
2. **Modal opens immediately** with loading state
3. **First image appears** as soon as it's generated
4. **Subsequent images appear** progressively in real-time
5. Thumbnail grid updates dynamically
6. Full visibility into generation progress

## Technical Details

### Progressive Update Mechanism
1. Job starts ‚Üí Modal opens with empty results
2. SSE/Polling receives status update with `resultId`
3. `loadJobResults` fetches current state from backend
4. Results state updates with new images
5. React re-renders modal with updated images
6. Process repeats until job completes

### State Management
- `testResults` state updates on each progress event
- Modal stays open throughout generation
- `showResultsModal` flag prevents reopening
- Silent updates prevent log spam

### Backwards Compatibility
- Works with both SSE and polling fallback
- Handles empty results gracefully
- Existing "Browse Results" functionality unchanged
- Completed test suites load normally

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see results as they generate
2. **Better UX**: No more waiting blindly for completion
3. **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of how many images completed
4. **Non-Blocking**: Can view results while generation continues
5. **Real-time Updates**: Images appear within seconds of generation

## Testing

### To Test Progressive Loading
1. Open Validator tab
2. Select a style and model
3. Select a test suite
4. Click "Run Test Suite"
5. **Verify**: Modal opens immediately
6. **Verify**: Loading message appears
7. **Verify**: First image appears within ~30 seconds
8. **Verify**: Subsequent images appear progressively
9. **Verify**: Thumbnail grid updates in real-time
10. **Verify**: Counter updates: "All Results (X)"

### Expected Behavior
- Modal opens instantly (< 1 second)
- Loading spinner visible initially
- Images appear one by one as they complete
- No errors in console
- Smooth updates without flickering

## Notes

- The backend must save partial results as images complete
- SSE/polling must include `resultId` in running status updates
- Images array grows progressively from 0 to total count
- Modal can be closed and reopened without losing progress
