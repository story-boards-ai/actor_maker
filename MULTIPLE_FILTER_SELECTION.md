# Multiple Filter Selection - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Upgraded the filter system from single-selection to **multiple filter selection**, allowing you to combine filters with AND logic.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **Before (Single Selection):**
```
Click "15+ Images" → Shows actors with 15+ images
Click "Good Only" → Replaces previous filter, shows good actors
```

### **After (Multiple Selection):**
```
Click "15+ Images" → Shows actors with 15+ images
Click "Good Only" → Adds to filter, shows actors with 15+ images AND good
Click "Stylized" → Adds to filter, shows actors with 15+ AND good AND stylized
```

## 🔄 Filter Behavior

### **Toggle On/Off:**
- **First Click**: Activates filter (button lights up)
- **Second Click**: Deactivates filter (button grays out)
- **Multiple Clicks**: Toggle on/off repeatedly

### **AND Logic:**
All active filters must match for an actor to be shown.

**Example:**
```
Active Filters: [15+ Images] + [Good Only] + [Stylized]
Result: Shows actors that have:
  - 15 or more training images
  AND are marked as good
  AND have stylized images
```

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### **Filter Button States:**

**Inactive (Gray):**
```css
background: #f1f5f9 (light gray)
color: #475569 (dark gray)
```

**Active (Colored):**
- **Missing 0/1**: Red (`#ef4444`)
- **15+ Images**: Green (`#10b981`)
- **Good Only**: Green (`#10b981`)
- **Stylized**: Purple (`#8b5cf6`)
- **No Training**: Orange (`#f59e0b`)

### **Count Display:**
```
25 of 100 actors (3 filters)
```
Shows how many filters are active.

### **With Inversion:**
```
25 of 100 actors (3 filters - inverted)
```

## 🎯 Example Combinations

### **1. Well-Trained Good Actors:**
```
Click: 📸 15+ Images
Click: ✓ Good Only
Result: Actors with 15+ images AND marked as good
```

### **2. Good Stylized Actors:**
```
Click: ✓ Good Only
Click: 🎨 Stylized
Result: Good actors that have stylized training images
```

### **3. Actors Needing Attention:**
```
Click: ⚠️ Missing 0/1
Click: 📸 15+ Images
Result: Actors with 15+ images but missing image 0 or 1
```

### **4. Untrained Non-Good Actors:**
```
Click: ∅ No Training
Click: ✓ Good Only
Click: ⊘ Invert
Result: Actors with no training AND not marked as good
```

### **5. Find Gaps in Training:**
```
Click: 📸 15+ Images
Click: ⊘ Invert
Click: ∅ No Training
Click: ⊘ Invert (again)
Result: Actors with 1-14 images (have some but less than 15)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Management:**

**Before:**
```typescript
const [filter, setFilter] = useState<FilterType>('all');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [activeFilters, setActiveFilters] = useState<Set<FilterType>>(new Set());
```

### **Toggle Function:**
```typescript
const toggleFilter = (filterType: FilterType) => {
  setActiveFilters(prev => {
    const newFilters = new Set(prev);
    if (newFilters.has(filterType)) {
      newFilters.delete(filterType);  // Turn off
    } else {
      newFilters.add(filterType);     // Turn on
    }
    return newFilters;
  });
};
```

### **Filter Logic (AND):**
```typescript
// Check each active filter
const filterResults: boolean[] = [];

if (activeFilters.has('missing_0_1')) {
  filterResults.push(/* check condition */);
}
if (activeFilters.has('has_15_plus')) {
  filterResults.push(/* check condition */);
}
// ... more filters

// Actor must match ALL active filters
const matches = filterResults.every(result => result === true);
```

## 🎯 Clear All Button

### **Renamed from "All":**
- **Old**: "All" button (selected by default)
- **New**: "Clear All" button (clears all filters)

### **Behavior:**
```
Click "Clear All"
→ Removes all active filters
→ Turns off inversion
→ Shows all actors
```

### **Active State:**
- Purple gradient when no filters active and no inversion
- Gray when any filters active or inversion on

## 📊 Use Cases

### **Quality Control:**
```
[Good Only] + [15+ Images] + [Stylized]
→ Find production-ready actors with diverse training
```

### **Find Problems:**
```
[Missing 0/1] + [Good Only]
→ Find good actors that need image 0/1 regenerated
```

### **Training Progress:**
```
[15+ Images] + [⊘ Invert]
→ Find actors needing more training data
```

### **Style Diversity:**
```
[15+ Images] + [Stylized] + [⊘ Invert]
→ Find actors with 15+ images but no stylized variety
```

### **Comprehensive Check:**
```
[Good Only] + [15+ Images] + [Missing 0/1] + [⊘ Invert]
→ Find good actors with 15+ images AND have both 0 and 1
```
