# Removed Hashing and Sync Functionality

## Overview

Removed all MD5 hashing and sync functionality related to training data since we moved to S3-only architecture.

## Files Deleted

### Python Scripts (Training Data Sync)
- ✅ `scripts/comprehensive_sync_training_data.py` - Comprehensive sync with hashing
- ✅ `scripts/sync_training_data_to_manifests.py` - Manifest sync with MD5 hashing
- ✅ `scripts/s3_sync_fast.py` - Fast S3 sync
- ✅ `scripts/s3_compare.py` - S3 comparison with hashing

### TypeScript Handlers
- ✅ `ui/config/routes/actors/s3-sync.handlers.ts` - Sync from/to S3 handlers

## Code Removed

### API Routes (index.ts)
- ✅ Removed `handleSyncFromS3` import
- ✅ Removed `handleSyncToS3` import
- ✅ Removed `handleComprehensiveSync` import
- ✅ Removed `/training-data/sync-from-s3` route
- ✅ Removed `/training-data/sync-to-s3` route
- ✅ Removed `/training-data/comprehensive-sync` route

### API Handlers (training-data.handlers.ts)
- ✅ Removed `handleComprehensiveSync()` function (75 lines)

## What Was NOT Removed

### MD5 Functions Still Used (Not Training Data Related)

**`ui/config/routes/captions-api.ts`**:
- `calculateMD5()` - Used for caption file verification
- Purpose: Matches S3 ETag for non-multipart uploads
- **Keep**: Used for captions, not training data

**`ui/config/routes/images-api.ts`**:
- `calculateMD5()` - Used for image file verification  
- Purpose: Matches S3 ETag for non-multipart uploads
- **Keep**: Used for general images, not training data

### Python Scripts Still Used

**`scripts/s3_upload.py`**:
- Contains MD5 hashing for S3 uploads
- **Keep**: General purpose S3 upload utility

**`scripts/migrate_characters_from_wm.py`**:
- Contains MD5 hashing for migration
- **Keep**: One-time migration script

## Summary

### Removed (Training Data Specific)
- 4 Python sync scripts
- 1 TypeScript handler file
- 3 API route handlers
- 1 comprehensive sync function
- All training data MD5 hashing logic

### Kept (General Purpose)
- MD5 functions for captions API
- MD5 functions for images API
- General S3 upload utilities
- Migration scripts

## Result

The codebase is now cleaner with:
- ✅ No training data sync complexity
- ✅ No training data MD5 hashing
- ✅ No local/S3 comparison logic
- ✅ S3-only architecture fully implemented
- ✅ General purpose MD5 functions preserved for other features
