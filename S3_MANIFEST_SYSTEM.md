# S3 Manifest System

## Overview

Automatic tracking system for S3 training data uploads. Each style gets its own JSON manifest file that records all uploaded files with complete metadata.

## üîÑ Automatic Updates

### When Manifests Are Updated

**1. During Sync to S3:**
- After successful upload of files
- Records each uploaded file with metadata
- Updates `last_synced` timestamp
- Recalculates `total_files` and `total_size_bytes`

**2. File Metadata Captured:**
- ‚úÖ Filename
- ‚úÖ S3 key (full path in bucket)
- ‚úÖ S3 URL (direct access URL)
- ‚úÖ File size in bytes
- ‚úÖ MD5 hash (for integrity verification)
- ‚úÖ Upload timestamp
- ‚úÖ Local file path (for reference)

**3. Manifest Maintenance:**
- Existing file entries are replaced on re-upload
- Files are sorted alphabetically by filename
- Totals are automatically recalculated

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. **Training Data Audit**
Know exactly what training data is in S3 for each style:
```bash
# View manifest
GET /api/s3/manifest?styleId=16
```

### 2. **Sync Verification**
Verify local files match S3 versions:
- Compare local MD5 hash with manifest MD5
- Check file sizes match
- Verify timestamps

### 3. **Backup & Recovery**
Restore training data from S3:
- Manifest lists all files and their S3 locations
- Download specific files or entire style dataset
- Verify integrity after download using MD5 hashes

### 4. **Storage Management**
Track storage usage per style:
- `total_size_bytes` shows storage used
- `total_files` shows number of training images
- Identify styles with large datasets

### 5. **Debugging**
Troubleshoot sync issues:
- Check when files were last uploaded
- Verify S3 URLs are correct
- Compare local paths with S3 keys

## üí° Implementation Details

### Upload Process with Manifest Update

**Step 1: Upload Files**
```python
# In Python script
for img in images:
    # Upload to S3
    result = client.upload_image(file_data, bucket, s3_key, extension=ext)
    
    # Record upload details
    uploaded_files.append({
        'filename': img['filename'],
        's3_key': s3_key,
        's3_url': f"https://{bucket}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{s3_key}",
        'size_bytes': file_size,
        'md5_hash': md5_hash,
        'uploaded_at': datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z',
        'local_path': img['localPath']
    })
```

**Step 2: Update Manifest**
```typescript
// In Node.js handler
if (parsedResult.uploaded > 0 && parsedResult.uploaded_files) {
  await updateS3Manifest(projectRoot, styleId, parsedResult.uploaded_files)
}
```

**Step 3: Manifest Update Logic**
```typescript
async function updateS3Manifest(projectRoot, styleId, uploadedFiles) {
  // Load or create manifest
  let manifest = loadOrCreateManifest(styleId)
  
  // Update file entries (replace if exists)
  for (const file of uploadedFiles) {
    manifest.files = manifest.files.filter(f => f.filename !== file.filename)
    manifest.files.push(file)
  }
  
  // Update metadata
  manifest.last_synced = new Date().toISOString()
  manifest.total_files = manifest.files.length
  manifest.total_size_bytes = sum(manifest.files.map(f => f.size_bytes))
  
  // Save
  fs.writeFileSync(manifestPath, JSON.stringify(manifest, null, 2))
}
```

### Per-File Information
- **Filename**: Original filename
- **S3 Key**: Full path in S3 bucket
